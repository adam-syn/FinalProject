# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pac-Sim: A Pac-Man Simulator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This project will let you play the classic arcade game pac man. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Pac-Sim will recreate the classic Pac-Man game in a 2D simulation, where players navigate a maze to collect pellets while avoiding four ghosts.
The game will feature customizable difficulty levels, with options to adjust ghost speed, number of lives, and maze complexity. The AI-driven ghosts will exhibit distinct behaviors like random wandering and predictive chasing.
Key features include a main menu, a scoring system, power-ups, and a game-over/restart mechanism. Developed using a 2D graphics engine like Pygame, the game will be a standalone desktop (and possibly web) application.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A working version of Pac-Sim where the player can navigate the maze, eat pellets, and avoid the ghosts, with a basic scoring system and game-over mechanics in place.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A complete version of Pac-Sim with functional ghost AI behaviors, multiple difficulty levels, and a main menu that includes options for starting a new game, changing settings, and viewing high scores.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

An advanced version of Pac-Sim with fully optimized ghost AI, customizable mazes, sound effects, animations, and an integrated high-score leaderboard that saves progress between sessions.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To get started on Pac-Sim, the first step will be learning how to create a basic 2D game using Pygame, focusing on rendering graphics, handling user input, and managing game loops. Key tasks include designing and animating the Pac-Man and ghost characters, programming the ghost behaviors, and implementing collision detection.

Next, I will research how to add a simple scoring system and save high scores. If collaborating, one teammate could focus on graphics and animations, while another handles the game mechanics and AI logic.
